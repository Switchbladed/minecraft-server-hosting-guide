            Minecraft is an extremely customizable game that allows you to create anything you can imagine. You're surely familiar with creative mode in Minecraft which allows you to build any structure, but beyond this is also possible to customize with plugins and mods. Modpacks are extremely popular and allow many changes to be made to the game. You can Google "Feed The Beast" and "Technic" to find some popular modpacks. It is also possible to run modpacks on a Minecraft server to play with friends. On a Minecraft server, you can also install plugins which allow you to change the way the game works as well, and install minigames such as Survival Games, Sky Wars and more. To start a Minecraft server, you will need to find a Minecraft server host, which I will describe in more detail below.

          <h2>Starting a Minecraft Server</h2>
          <p>
            To start a Minecraft server, you will need to choose a Minecraft host. There are many hosts available, such as Shockbyte. You can visit Shockbyte's website at <a href="https://shockbyte.com/">https://shockbyte.com</a>. Once you are on the Shockbyte website, navigate to the Minecraft server plans page and you will see a list of plans to choose from. Choosing your plan will be based on the amount of RAM you need for your server. The amount of RAM you need for your Minecraft server varies depending on the amount of players, plugins and worlds you wish to use. Generally it is recommended to have 1GB of RAM for every 20 players on your server. Most hosts, including Shockbyte will allow you to upgrade at a later time, so if you're not sure you can usually pick a smaller plan and upgrade later. Shockbyte supports all server types, including Vanilla, Bedrock Edition, Spigot, Craftbukkit, Forge, Thermos, Sponge and more. If you wish to want to connect multiple servers together, you can use BungeeCord which is also supported by Shockbyte. The video linked below is a tutorial for installing BungeeCord. Alternatively, you can find a text guide here: <a href="https://medium.com/shockbyte/bungeecord-network-misconceptions-3c1e6eb1a9ec">https://medium.com/shockbyte/bungeecord-network-misconceptions-3c1e6eb1a9ec</a>. Once you have installed BungeeCord, you can configure it and add your additional servers as per the tutorial.
